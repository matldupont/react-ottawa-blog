# September 27th, 2018 - 3rd meetup

## *Attention* 
#### Rebel.com has changed locations so make sure you don't head to the location of the August meetup.

Since this is our THIRD meetup we want your feedback on everything as we move forward!

The schedule will go as follows:

- 3 Talks (each talk is at most 20 minutes)
- Time to program/as questions/ chat (during this time every month we will be hosting a little "learn React from ground up" workshop)

So bring yourself, and your computing device!

We will announce the talks as we get closer to the date!

Look forward to seeing you there!
